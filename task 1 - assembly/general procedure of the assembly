steps that i used to assemble the robotics arm are:
- Firstly, open any CAD software - i used solidworks and tinkercad - and open an assembly containing all the parts
- secondly, put the base down as the first thing in the assembly
- thirdly, put the waist above the base in a way that it cover the hole of the base
- fourthly, attach the first arm to the waist by installing a screw in the holes 
- fifthly, connect the second arm to the first
- sixthly, attach the end-effector to the second arm


along the way don't forget to put the motors in the squared voids and to connect the screws in the holes
